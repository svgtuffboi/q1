Instructions:

The problem: Finding the highest (Maximum) number from a given list of numbers.


PseudoCode 1

PseudoCode 2

Algorithm FindMax1(numbers)

   max ← numbers[0]

   For i from 1 to length(numbers)-1

      If numbers[i] > max Then

         max ← numbers[i]

      EndIf

   EndFor

   Return max

EndAlgorithm



Algorithm FindMax2(numbers)

   For i from 0 to length(numbers)-1bigger ← true

      For j from 0 to length(numbers)-1

         If numbers[j] > numbers[i] Then

            bigger ← false

         EndIf

      EndFor

      If bigger = true Then

         Return numbers[i]

      EndIf

   EndFor

EndAlgorithm
